‘Soviet Union, 1950s. The mountaintops of the Nagorno-Karabakh area in the heart
of Azerbaijan were still peppered by both Armenian and Azerbaijani villages,
some of each yet to be completely wiped out by war between the two communities
35 years later.
In autumn, rows of grape vines interspersed with the crimson of pomegranate
orchards weaved the way to the village of Godrud, the peaks covered in heavy
snow. But it was in June when Nina, the eldest of the many children in their
extended family, would leave Baku to spend the following three months with her
grandparents in the predominantly Armenian Karabakh mountains.
Before they set off, their car would always be filled with
A sac of flour
A sac of sugar
A sac of wheat ,to feed the chickens
A sac of rice, which was incredibly important
Three large jars of clarified butter, prepared in advance by her grandmotherA
large canister of sunflower oil
When they arrived at the village, Nina’s grandfather would always buy (and then
sell again if anything was left at the end of their stay) the following:
A white horse ,to swiftly move around the hills
Chickens, cockerels and turkeys
A few sheep, rams and goats.’
