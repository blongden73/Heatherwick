“In 2013 I spent a summer researching and drawing
in the Herbarium at Kew Gardens. It felt like there
were endless possibilities inside the vast rooms
with their towering shelves, and I loved the soft
light and silence, the system of ordering, and the
rules of handling the pressed specimens. But most
of all, I loved working somewhere knowledge
seemed to be a shared and growing entity.”
