“I really enjoy writing. This is my eighth play. I've written about domestic violence and children's rights, because a lot of parents in the villages don't understand children's rights. People who live in the cities are really informed but people in the villages are not. What I like about the dramas is I am reaching the people in the villages, trying to change their mindset, and that is a real pleasure.”
