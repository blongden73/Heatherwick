  Quote: "Next to the summer kitchen, we have a garage, and a barn which is used as
    a\ncowshed and pigpen. Right by it all is our vegetable patch, and then there’s
    the\nallotment. The other, bigger allotment, is a 30 minute walk away.\nMy brightest
    memory comes from a summer’s day. Hail started and everyone\nappeared in the summer
    kitchen. The big dog was lying on the floor, five cats\nwere sleeping on the bench.
    My granny was cooking something for supper. \nI was sitting and listening to the
    radio. After that the sun came out and the view of\nthe garden from the window
    was enchanting.”\n\n- Sofia Vozniuk"

“On the shelves, there are different teas and cups. Inside the kitchen cabinet are forks, knives and spoons, salt and other supplies.
Sparrows made their nest near the drain pipe outside the kitchen. 
Also there are always a lot of spiders inside. The main house is separated from the kitchen by a narrow three-metre pathway, and is only used for sleeping, well, I guess the fridge is there! But it is the summer kitchen that is used for cooking food for family members. In the hall, as I mentioned, small chickens live. 
But only in the summer".
