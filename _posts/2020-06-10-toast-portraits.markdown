“Rome is a city of pilgrims, inclusive as well as excluding. Living in
Testaccio, you’re physically in a big city, but it has the soul and the head of
a provincial town, and the heart of a gossipy little village. Anyone can join in
with the joys and frustrations of it, from politics to rubbish collection.”

- Rachel Roddy
