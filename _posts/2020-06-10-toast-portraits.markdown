“Stewardship is the belief that humans are 
responsible for taking care of the world around 
them, and this is an ethic that Willow evokes 
at the heart of her work. Like many other 
foragers, it is vital that exact source of her 
sea buckthorn is not revealed, but this is less 
to do with keeping the treasure for herself but 
in protecting the plant and understanding that 
other coastal inhabitants need to share it too. 
Earlier today as we climbed down to the dunes we disturbed a flock of field fares that flew out across the dunes from their shrubby winter nesting grounds. This is an essential feeding station for migratory birds as the landscape combines mudflats, salt and freshwater marshes, dunes and woodland as well as this extensive network of sea buckthorn.”
