    in the summer kitchen. The big dog was lying on the floor, five cats\nwere sleeping
    on the bench. My granny was cooking something for supper. \nI was sitting and
    listening to the radio. After that the sun came out and the view of\nthe garden
    from the window was enchanting.”\n\n- Sofia Vozniuk"

## Recipes and Reminiscences from Every Corner of Ukraine
### By Olia Hercules  
### Published by Bloomsbury  

“On the shelves, there are different teas and cups. Inside the kitchen cabinet are forks, knives and spoons, salt and other supplies.
Sparrows made their nest near the drain pipe outside the kitchen. 
Also there are always a lot of spiders inside. The main house is separated from the kitchen by a narrow three-metre pathway, and is only used for sleeping, well, I guess the fridge is there! But it is the summer kitchen that is used for cooking food for family members. In the hall, as I mentioned, small chickens live. 
But only in the summer."
